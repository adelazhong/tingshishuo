This project is a mobile application for Chinese poetry. The project is designed to provide a platform for reading, sharing, communicating and learning for lovers of Chinese poetry. This application includes poetry search, poetry reading recording, automatic generation of poetry, poetry sharing and other functions. Before the application development, I made a functional analysis of several common poetry learning applications and found that most applications only have a searching function, lack of fun. So this application adds automatic generation of poetry, community function, and poetry style analysis, to increase interest.
